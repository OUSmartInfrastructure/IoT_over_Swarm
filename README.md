# IoT_over_Swarm
This project is for setting up a green-roof IoT device to communicate using the Swarm M138 boards over satellite network.
The objectives of the project are to monitor and manage green spaces, promote environmental sustainability, and leverage advanced technologies for positive social and ecological impacts.
## Project Objectives
* Promote Remote Monitoring: The project seeks to promote remote monitoring of green roofs in real-time;enabling constant observation and analysis of environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, moisture levels, light intensity, wind speed,  air quality, and biodivisty.
* Promote Environmental Sustainability: The project contributes to environmental sustaninability by promoting green spaces, reducing heat island effects in urban areas, and improving air quality.
* Encourage Low cost solutions: The Swarm M138 boards offer low-cost, low-power, and long-range communications over satellite in areas where traditional networks may be unavailable or unreliable thereby making it suitable reduced maintenance costs and improved environmental monitoring.
* Scalability: The project could be scaled to monitor mulitple greeen roofs across different locations to provide valuable data for urban planning, environmental research, and sustainable development initiatives.
* Research and Innovation: The project fosters research and innovation in the fields of IoT, satellite communication, and environmental monitoring to the development of new technologies and solutions for sustainable urban development.
