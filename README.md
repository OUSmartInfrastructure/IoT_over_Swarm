# IoT_over_Swarm
This project is for setting up a green-roof IoT device to communicate using the Swarm M138 bords over satellite network.
The objectives of the project are to monitor and manage green spaces, promote environmental sustainability, and leverage advanced technologies for positive social and ecological impacts.
## Project Objectives
* Promote Remote Monitoring: We seek to promote remote monitoring of green roofs in real-time by enabling constant observation and analysis of environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, moisture levels, light intensity, wind speed,  air quality, and biodivisty.
